Flashcards for Android

Old project circa 2014.

Flash cards have to be prepared separately in one of the following formats:
1. Key is surrounded by underscores and can be found anywhere within a phrase (multiple keys are OK)
2. Entry format is $word['key'] = 'phrase'
3. Phrase is a collection of keys separated by TAB character

Naturally, the flashcard data was created before this app:)
